        <h2>Weekly CS Seminars</h2>
        <h3>Location and Times</h3>
        <p><strong>G/002</strong> at <strong>13:15</strong> every Wednesday.</p>

        <h3>Structure</h3>
        <p>We intend to pick textbooks and other such resources, and work through them over a period of time. Each seminar shall begin with a short presentation of the current topic, followed by discussion of that topic. Once it has been exhausted, we shall move on to general computer science and programming discussion.</p>
        <p>It is not essential to have done the reading to attend the seminars, nor do we want it to be. If you want to do the reading beforehand and think about things before we all discuss it, that's great!</p>

        <h3>Content</h3>
        <h4>Design Patterns (Gang of Four)</h4>
        <p>We will work through all of the design patterns in the gang of four (<em>Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software</em>), covering two each week. This will keep us occupied for some time. This seminar series is starting in <strong>Spring Week 5 of 2012/13</strong>, and happening every week during term time.</p>
        <p>We shall cover the following topics in order:</p>

        <ol>
          <li>Creational Patterns (Spr 5 to Spr 9)</li>
          <li>Structural Pattern (Spr 10 to Sum 3)</li>
          <li>Behavioural Patterns (Sum 4 to Sum 9)</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Contact</h2>
