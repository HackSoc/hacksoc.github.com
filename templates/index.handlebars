  <h2>Boardgames and Cake</h2>
  <p>In one of the oldest and noblest traditions of HackSoc, we descend upon a room, play many boardgames, and eat much cake. Both boardgames and cake are brought along by members, so if you do enjoy the events, please consider bringing something along.</p>
</div>

<div class="infobox">
  <h2>CoffeeScript</h2>
  <p>An unprecedented case of joviality and camaraderie has struck HackSoc, and we have responded with a weekly social over in the Glasshouse on Hes East. Come for lunch, a chat, and maybe a small game or two.</p>
</div>

<div class="infobox">
  <h2>HackPub</h2>
  <p>Another tradition with a long and glorious history, the humble HackPub, in which we visit the Rook and Gaskill near Walmgate and converse late into the night with members <strong>past</strong> and present about high culture, politics, and how old jet engines work over a pint (of something non-alcoholic, if you so desire).</p>
</div>

<div class="infobox">
  <h2>Movie Nights</h2>
  <p>Sometimes two films complement each other so perfectly that it becomes inconcievable to watch one without also watching the other. Or sometimes two films fall naturally into a coherent theme. We gather to appreciate such pairings a few times a term.</p>
</div>

<div class="infobox">
  <h2>Talks</h2>
  <p>In which we sit in a room en masse and listen to someone who thinks they know what they're talking about. Usually we have industrial or academic speakers, but we occasionally have student talks too.</p>
