<h2>Computer Science &amp; Programming</h2>

    <h3>Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs</h3>
    <span>Also known as <strong>SICP</strong>.
      Available <a href="https://mitpress.mit.edu/sicp/full-text/book/book.html">online</a> and in the library (SK 50 ABE)</span>
  </header>

  <p>One of the bibles of the computer science world, SICP doesn't
  teach you a programming language, but teaches you programming. It
  uses the Scheme language to do so, as it is very simple and so there
  isn't much to learn about it. The book is perhaps a bit fast-paced,
  but it includes many examples and exercises, all of which should be
  worked through to get a proper appreciation and understanding of the
  text. One of the few books universally held to make you a better
  programmer upon reading.</p>

    <h3>The Art of Computer Programming</h3>
    <span>Also known as <strong>TAOCP</strong>.
      Available in the library (SK 50 KNU)</span>
  </header>

  <p>A masterpiece of computer science lore, currently in three
  volumes and several fascicles. Bill Gates once said, &quot;you
  should definitely send me a résumé if you can read the whole
  thing&quot;. Don Knuth, father of the analysis of algorithms,
  presents a very rigorous and in-depth treatment of many topics in
  computer science. A bit tedious in parts, especially as Knuth
  invented his own computer architecture in order to describe
  algorithms, but a wealth of knowledge that should be an essential
  member of any CS student's or academic's shelf.</p>

    <h3>The Art of UNIX Programming</h3>
    <span>Available <a href="http://catb.org/esr/writings/taoup/html/">online</a> and in the library (SK 56 UNI/R)</span>
  </header>

  <p>The Unix operating systems have endured for decades, despite
  massive changes in computing technology, if nothing else, this
  suggests Unix got something right. This book attempts to teach you
  the design and programming principles that have helped Unix to stand
  the test of time, and Unix software to be both powerful and simple.</p>

    <h3>Purely Functional Data Structures</h3>
    <span>Available in the library (SK 50 OKA)</span>
  </header>

  <p>There exist numerous books which deal with data structures from the
  perspective of imperative, low-level languages, such as C and Java. 
  Okasaki presents numerous common (and some uncommon) data structures from a
  purely functional view point. Okasaki also analyses the runtime performance
  of many of these data structures throughout this book, even in the presence
  of lazy semantics. Essential reading for anyone planning to write substantial
  amounts of code in any functional language.</p>
</article>


<h2>Programming Languages</h2>

<article>
  <header>
    <h3>The C Programming Language</h3>
    <span>Also known as <strong>K&amp;R</strong>.
      Available in the library (SK 59 C/K)</span>
  </header>

  <p>The definitive reference guide to C. The book is quite terse and
  may, perhaps, not be suited for those without prior programming
  experience, but if you want to learn C, this is where you should
  go.</p>
</article>

<article>
  <header>
    <h3>Learn You a Haskell for Great Good!</h3>
    <span>Also known as <strong>LYAH</strong>.
      Available <a href="http://learnyouahaskell.com/chapters">online</a>.</span>
  </header>

  <p>A guide explaining the basics of Haskell and functional
  programming, written for those with some background in imperative
  programming. Covers both the language and the mindset needed to
  solve problems in a functional way.</p>
</article>

<h2>Miscellaneous</h2>

<article>
  <header>
    <h3>The Cathedral and the Bazaar</h3>
    <span>Available <a href="http://www.catb.org/esr/writings/homesteading/cathedral-bazaar/">online</a> and in the library (SK 9 RAY)</span>
  </header>

  <p>A historical account of the origins of the hacker community; the
  rise and fall of the Unixes; and the subsequent rise of Linux and
  open source software. Interesting as both a historical account and a
  cultural record, but will probably bore people with no interest in
  open source.</p>
