<p>IRC, or Internet Relay Chat, is a protocol with a long and glorious
history stretching back into the mists of time. It's a pretty simple
system for online chatrooms, and you don't even need a special program
to connect to it, although they do exist.</p>

<ol>
  <li>You don't need a special program: see the <a href="http://webchat.freenode.net?channels=cs-york">web chat</a></li>

  <li>You don't talk to individuals on a contact list, you join channels: a group of people talking about the same topic.</li>

  <li>When you start up a client you'll have to connect to a server and channel. We use <strong>#cs-york</strong> on <strong>irc.freenode.net</strong></li>

  <li>You can change your name with <code>/nick new_name</code>, and join a new channel with <code>/join #channel_name</code></li>
</ol>

<p>We are happy to help if you would like to dicuss a Computer Science-related problem you encountered, but we would appreciate if you could follow these guidelines:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Please ask your question straight away. You do not need to first check if anyone is in the channel.</li>

  <li>Please focus your question on particular issues. We are more likely to be able to help you on particular problems you don't understand, than a long list of homework questions for us to check through.</li>

  <li>Please be as detailed as possible (e.g. "why does this particular error occur in my code?"), with links to your code or illustrating images where applicable. Please also describe any prior attempts you have made to solve the problem.
</ol>
