        <h2>Distributed Domain Name System</h2>
        <h3>Project Overview</h3>
        <p>We aim to implement a distributed domain name system using public key cryptography and a web of trust for security, with the Kademlia distributed hash table as a backing store for the data. The first version will consist of a simple distributed hosts file, and this will be extended to consist of a distributed tree structure once we've figured everything out for the simple case.</p>
        <p>Programming shall be in Java 7, as it is widely-known and very easy to use.</p>

        <h3>Events</h3>
        <h4>Version Control and Teamwork</h4>
        <p><strong>Thursday the 31st of January at 20:15</strong>. Room currently undecided.</p>
        <p>A short session on what version control is and where you would want to use it, with more explanation of how to use Git, a popular VCS. Additionally, how to use version control for team projects without making your colleagues hate your guts and try to kill you as you sleep.</p>

        <h4>Public Key Cryptography and Key Signing Party</h4>
        <p><strong>Thursday the 7th of February at 20:15</strong>. Room currently undecided.</p>
        <p>What public-key crypto is and where it's useful, with a focus on the concept of a web of trust and how it'll be useful in our system. After this, there shall be an opportunity for people with GPG/PGP keys to have them signed by producing proof of identity and their key fingerprint.</p>

        <h4>Weekly CS Seminar</h4>
        <p><strong>Every Wednesday Lunchtime</strong>. Room currently undecided.</p>
        <p>We will work through the Gang of Four book, starting the session by having someone present a topic from the book which will be followed by discussion of that topic, and then discussion of computer science in general. Everyone will be encouraged to give at least one presentation, although of course this is not mandatory.</p>
